Fremon ended his affair with the unknown woman and rented a cottage at the Haymarket Gardens, a verdant recreational park that Major John Pryor owned on the banks of the James River. A prominent Revolutionary War veteran who had fought under George Washington, Pryor was a wealthy Richmond businessman, proprietor of the largest livery stable in the capital, and secretary of the influential Jockey Club. The repulsively vulgar seventy-five-year-old was notorious not only for his shady horse racing ventures but also for his arresting thirty-year-old wife. The improbable match was a classically tawdry tale of decayed southern gentry and social expediency. Charles Fremon's emergence as Anne Pryor's French teacher would only add to the drama.

Anne Beverley Whiting was the youngest of fifteen children. Her father, Colonel Thomas Whiting, a Virginia landholder who had been a leading member of the House of Burgesses, had been the king's attorney before the American Revolution. President of the Naval Board during the Revolution-a most dignified position-Whiting's lineage traced a connection through marriage to George Washington, whom he had held as an infant during the future president's baptism. His Elmington estate encompassed all the acreage in Gloucester County between the North and Ware rivers. It was to his third wife, Elizabeth Sewall, that Anne was born.

Whiting died when Anne was six months old. His estate was divided equally among his surviving children, each of whom also received "thirty negroes," according to his will. As a baby, Anne was powerless to protect her inheritance, and when her mother married Samuel Carey, Anne's fortune dwindled as Carey directed the family's finances. The five children from Whiting's first marriage engaged in protracted, and apparently unsuccessful, litigation against Carey in an effort to acquire control of the bequests. With the death of her mother, the orphaned Anne found the Carey home intolerable-"disagreeable from the vexations of lawsuits"-and moved in with her married sister Catherine.

By age seventeen, Anne had blossomed into a graceful belle, and Catherine avidly sought a suitable mate for the dispossessed girl. She settled on John Pryor as Anne's deliverer from what one observer called "the greatest of all calamities, poverty." Anne was repulsed by the gouty and crude man forty-five years her senior, and rebuffed his pursuit despite her sister's ardent efforts. Finally she relented, apparently entering the marriage in 1796 with stoic resignation. Her dowry included "the negroes contained in lot No. 3"-three men, two women, and two children who apparently constituted what was left of her inheritance.

From the start the arrangement was problematic, he a cantankerous and impotent elderly man-"a disabled, stiff-limbed old soldier," the Richmond Dispatch later portrayed him-she increasingly desperate in the loveless, childless union. Her bride's nest was a modest, rambling structure on the grounds of Haymarket Gardens, consisting of two long wings and attached servants' quarters. "I was married too young to be sensible of the importance of the state in which I was about to enter," Anne wrote afterward, "and found when too late that I had acted with too much precipitancy, and could never feel that love for him to whom I was united, without which the marriage state of all others is the most wretched."

For twelve years she suffered in silence, eventually refusing to join Pryor in the fast-paced horsy set that was her husband's milieu, and slipping steadily into what was then called melancholia-the nineteenth-century euphemism for depression. Not until the stunningly handsome and wildly romantic Jean Fremon came to Richmond in 1810-taking up lodging on Pryor's estate-did Anne feel the stirrings of love for the first time in her life. Hired by Pryor to teach French to Anne, Fremon lured her smoothly into an affair. Though as discreet as possible, their mutual arousal was impossible to hide, especially for the Byronic Fremon. They planned to wait for Pryor to die-then Anne would inherit his abundant holdings and the two would be free to marry-but their designs were preempted when her husband learned of the illicit liaison.

The hot-tempered Pryor confronted the two lovers on July 9, 1811, threatening first to kill Anne. "You may spare yourself the crime," she railed at him. "I shall leave your house tomorrow morning forever!" The two men exchanged threats, each vowing to kill the other, but by dawn the next day Anne and Charles had left Richmond. "I did not run away, but was turned out of doors at night and in an approaching storm," Anne later claimed. Anne "totally alienated her affections from me by the vile and invidious machinations of an execrable monster of baseness and depravity, with whom I have recently discovered she has for some time past indulged in criminal intercourse," Pryor declared in his divorce petition, published in the Virginia Patriot.

On the eve of the War of 1812, Richmond was a flourishing community of some seven thousand, what historian Jay Winik described as "a thriving hybrid of old-fashioned Southern gentility and newfangled urban enterprise." Such a city was primed to find interest in the couple's scurrilous conduct, and the scandal was rich fodder for gossip among Richmond's patrician society. But Anne and Charles embarked on their own adventure, apparently following Fremon's long-standing, and mysterious, interest in the character and condition of North American Indians, touring the Indian regions of the southeastern United States. Combining their assets, they loaded their belongings onto a stagecoach, and along with two of her slaves set out for Williamsburg and then Norfolk, where Anne would collect additional possessions in those towns-property Anne had apparently been granted the previous year as a result of litigation against her father's estate.

Family lore would have it that they had enough money between them to "gratify Fremon's wish to tour the South and learn something of the habits of the Indians, in which he felt a keen interest." His unexplained anthropological curiosity about American Indians is said to have fostered an early attachment to the subject in his son, John, the legend of his ethnographic exploration evolving with John's future fame. Though the story was no doubt embellished by a succeeding generation, the evidence suggests that the couple did indeed move from town to town, often camping for extended periods with Native Americans.

By October, they were settled in a tiny brick house in Savannah, Georgia, on the property of one of that town's more prominent citizens. Located in what was then known as the Yamacraw section of the small city, they set up housekeeping while awaiting her final divorce so they could marry. Their funds nearly exhausted, Charles began advertising his services as a teacher of French and dancing instructor, and Anne sought boarders to supplement their meager holdings. "We are poor," she wrote a friend at this time, "but we can be content with little, for I have found that happiness consists not in riches."

The Virginia House of Delegates declined Pryor's divorce petition on December 11, 1811, and when Anne's first child, John Charles, was born January 21, 1813, the birth was possibly out of wedlock. Much would be made of John's illegitimacy later in his life-by both political rivals and psychological biographers-his future marred by "the dual heritage of scandal and the blunt label of bastard." Observers would attribute John's driving ambition, remote personality, and defiance of authority to this hapless beginning. Still, his early family life was affectionate and stimulating-his nanny the bighearted "Black Hannah," inherited by his mother, had accompanied the family from Richmond. Overall it was a time that he remembered with fondness despite its many hardships. "A child of love, a child who knew the meaning of discrimination before he knew the word," wrote his biographer Ferol Egan, "Frémont came from a background with all the trappings of a Charles Dickens novel."

Shortly after John's birth, the couple took to wandering again. John later recalled his first memories as those of Indian villages, where his parents and their servants would tether their horses, aromatic smoke permeating their campsite. In an ironic twist of fate the toddler narrowly escaped a bullet fired by his future father-in-law. In September 1813, the Fremons were temporarily lodged at a Nashville hotel-alternatively identified in historical accounts as the City Hotel and Clayton Talbot's Tavern-where Thomas Hart Benton and his brother, Jesse, also were guests. Then an up-and-coming lawyer and Tennessee politician, Benton had come to Nashville to confront General Andrew Jackson, who had acted as a second for Jesse Benton's rival in a recent duel. The town had poured out to greet Jackson, celebrated for his role as a fighter of Indians and for his heroic march from Natchez to Nashville during the War of 1812. Undaunted by Jackson's fame and support, Benton was determined to avenge what he considered Jackson's brutal treatment of Jesse. Such frontier violence was commonplace, the days of Daniel Boone still fresh in the young nation's mind.

"The quarrel was an opera bouffe episode," according to historian Nevins, Jackson widely proclaiming his intention to horsewhip Benton. But after a volley of gunshots and a series of physical blows, it was Jackson who was carried away bleeding-the blood from the injury soaking two mattresses and leaving Jackson perilously close to death. The fracas left a minié ball from Jesse's pistol lodged in the future president's shoulder, and another stray bullet meant for Jackson penetrated the thin wall of the hotel room where John was sleeping with his traveling parents. Out of the duel between Jackson and Benton grew a friendship and political alliance that would benefit them both-and, fatefully, John.

The family would stay at least a year in Nashville, where Anne gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. They then moved back to Norfolk, hoping to settle permanently. Now that Pryor had died, Charles and Anne were free to marry-though there is no evidence that they ever did so-and the scandal that had surrounded their elopement had faded, though it was never wholly forgotten. Anne had many family members in Norfolk. Charles's brother, Francis, also still lived there, and the couple's third child, a boy named Horation "Frank" Francis,would be born there in 1817.

It had been seven of the happiest, most adventurous and fun-loving years of her life,Anne was by all accounts unconcerned about their improvident circumstances and passionately in love with her husband. But when Charles died suddenly that same year, she was left in utter poverty, a widow with three small children. Francis Fremon urged her to move to France with him. The recent accidental fatal shooting of Francis's sixteen-year-old son at a Fourth of July celebration had left him mourning and desirous of returning to his native land. There, Francis assured Anne, the Fremon clan would embrace her brood. But Anne felt herself an ingrained American and would not consider relocating.

Instead, she moved into quarters near the Dinwiddie Courthouse, where John received his first formal instruction. Little is known of their time in Norfolk after Charles's death, though Anne had now taken to calling herself "Mrs. Fremont" with the t. How she survived, owning no property and at thirty-seven years old facing an unpredictable and precarious future, can be attributed to her fortitude, energy, and devotion to her children. She would focus her hopes and dreams on her firstborn son, and John would gallantly rise to the call. He adored his mother, whom he saw as "a woman of most extraordinary grace and beauty, of gentle, captivating manners, with a sweet but singularly melancholy disposition." From that early bond forged with a romantic and independent woman his own respect and admiration of women would be formed.

In 1823, Anne, now nearly destitute, turned her sights several hundred miles down the coast to Charleston, South Carolina, determined as she was to rear her children in genteel surroundings while also offering them the opportunity that the bustling trade center might afford.
